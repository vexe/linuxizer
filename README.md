# linuxizer

Another one of my old programs.

A small C# utility that uses WinAPI to perform some window management tasks. It runs in the background so you just need to learn the keys/shortcuts:
- Ctrl-Alt-F have the currently active window follow the mouse
- Ctrl-Alt-T have the currently active window be always on top of other opened windows (press again to toggle)
- Ctrl-Alt-Numpad Plus/Minus: Increase/decrease the opacity of the currently active window
- Ctrl-Alt-X: Maximize current window
- Ctrl-Alt-M: Minimize current window
- Ctrl-Alt-Arrow keys: Snap current window to left/right/up/down
